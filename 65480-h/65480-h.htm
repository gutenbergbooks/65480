<p>Charles Thomas Walker was born on the 11th day of
January, 1858, at Hephzibah, Ga. Hephzibah is in Richmond
county about 14 miles south-west of Augusta. He
is the youngest of 11 children of whom 6 are dead and 5
are living. His father, Thomas Walker, was buried the
day before he was born. His mother, Mrs. Hannah Walker,
died in 1866, little Charley being, at the time, only 8
years old.</p>

<p>Thus, even before Charles was born, his mother was
draped in the weeds of widowhood, and he first opened
his eyes on the light of this world as a fatherless child.
Thus, also, in early childhood, even before he had any realizing
sense of his true condition, he was compelled by
the stern, but beneficent discipline of an Alwise Providence
to wail forth the cry of complete orphanage.</p>

<p>On Wednesday before the first Sunday in June, 1873,
while young Walker was hoeing cotton, he decided to
seek the Lord. He left the field that day and went into
the woods, and remained in the woods from Wednesday
afternoon without eating, drinking or seeing anyone, until
the following Saturday afternoon when he was converted.
He was baptised on the first Sunday in July by his uncle,
the Rev. Nathan Walker, then pastor of the Franklin
Covenant Church, a faithful servant of the Master, who
still lives, shedding light and love among the people.</p>

<p>Young Walker immediately became an active and
zealous Christian, and was impressed with the thought
that he was called of God to preach the gospel. Accordingly
in 1874, he entered the Augusta Institute, a theological
school located at Augusta and presided over by the
late Joseph T. Robert, D. D., L. L. D. This school has
since been moved to Atlanta and is now the Atlanta Baptist
Seminary. In school. Mr. Walker was soon celebrated
for his great ability, for his thoroughness of scholarship,
and for his exemplary deportment. He had only 6
dollars when he entered school. The first term he did
his own cooking; he cooked only twice a week—on Wednesdays
and Saturdays; so great was his desire for knowledge
that he felt that he could not spare the time to cook
every day. When he had spent his six dollars he picked
up his little bundle and was on the eve of leaving school.
Some of his student friends finding out the reasons of
his proposed departure and realizing what a loss it would
be to them and to the cause, remonstrated with him and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
urged him to be patient a day or so longer. One of his fellow
students, the Rev. Dr. Love, of Savannah, Ga., went
so far as to promise him that he would provide for him
personally until arrangements could be made. Mr. Walker
consented to remain; meanwhile Dr. Robert had been
informed and he, in turn succeeded in interesting three
gentlemen of Dayton Ohio, in young Walker and through
the kindness of these gentlemen, the motherless and fatherless
boy was enabled to prosecute his studies for 5
years at the Augusta Institute.</p>

<p>In 1876, in the 18th year of his age, Mr. Walker was
licensed to preach, and on the first Sunday in May, 1877,
he was ordained to the sacred office of the gospel ministry.
He soon became noted as a preacher, possessing, as he did
supreme eloquence and a fair knowledge of the scriptures.
In 1878 he was elected pastor of the Franklin Covenant
Baptist church, of which he was a member and by the
time he was 21 years old he was pastor of four country
churches and one city church; viz: Franklin Covenant Baptist
church, Hephzibah, Thankful Baptist Church,
Waynesboro, McKinnie’s Branch Baptist Church, Burke
county, Ebenezer Baptist church, Richmond county, and
Mount Olive Baptist church, Augusta, Ga. In 1880, he
pastored the First Baptist church in LaGrange. In 1882,
he was called to the pastorate of Central Baptist church,
Augusta, Ga., and the following year resigned and organized
the Tabernacle Baptist church, of which he is still
the honored and distinguished pastor.</p>

<p>Rev. Walker built the Tabernacle church in 1885 at a
cost of $13,500. It is a handsome brick structure, and was
dedicated in three months from the day it was commenced.
In the beginning its membership was 200. At present the
membership is 900, and Rev. Walker knows them every one
by name. Recently a new pipe organ has been put in the
edifice at a cost of $1,500. The building has already proved
too small to accommodate the great crowd that go to hear
this great man preacher, and efforts are being made to remodel
the house of worship and make it much larger.</p>

<p class="caption">Pastor of Tabernacle Baptist Church, Augusta, Ga., and
Treasurer of the National Baptist Convention of the
United States</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>Among the office of trust and responsibility which Rev.
Mr. Walker has held are the following: Moderator of the
Western Union Baptist Association, President of the Executive
Board of the missionary Baptist Convention of
Georgia, Secretary of the State Baptist Sunday School
convention for 8 years. Members of the Board of trustees of
the Walker Baptist College and treasurer of the American
National Baptist Convention, and Business Manager of
<span class="smcap">The Weekly Sentinel</span>.</p>

<p>The honorary degree of “Doctor of Divinity” was conferred
upon him in 1890 by the State University of Kentucky.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1891, Dr. Walker in company with
the Rev. E. R. Carter of Atlanta, Ga. took an extensive
trip through Europe and the Holy land and besides staying
for awhile in England and on the Continent and in
Asia, he took a peep over in to Africa. On his return he
lectured throughout the South and in Boston and New
York and every where with profit and success. Many of
the leading newspapers throughout country spoke in terms
of praise and admiration of the wonderful preacher and
lecturer.</p>

<p>The Rev Dr. Walker is only 34 years old—quite young
indeed to have accomplished so much for the advancement
of Christ’s Kingdom.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When Rev. Mr. Walker was leaving Hephzibah, in 1880, for LaGrange,
one of his white friends, Col. A. C. Walker, gave him a letter
of recommendation which speaks for itself. Here is what the letter
said:</p>

<p>“The bearer, Rev. C. T. Walker, is the fourth in descent from a
family of Negroes brought from Virginia to Burke county by my grand
father in 1773. As slaves they were noted for their admirable qualities
and as freemen have sustained their reputation.</p>

<p>Charles, by his energy, has obtained an excellent education and
for two years has been licensed teacher of one our public schools. His
character is irreproachable in all respects and by none is he esteemed
more than by the more intelligent white citizens among whom he
lives. It gives me great pleasure to testify to his worth and I most respectfully
ask for him the generous consideration of the new people,
with whom he is about to cast his lot. We sincerely regret his departure
from among us, as he was exercising a most happy influence
with his own race here.”</p>

<p>Rev. Walker came to Augusta in 1883. In 1885, upon the completion
of Tabernacle church, and on the day of its dedication all the
papers of Augusta spoke in highest praise of the work accomplished
and invariably referred to the edifice as an everlasting monument to
the perseverance and energy of the pastor, Rev. C. T. Walker.</p>

<p>Rev. Walker spent the fall of 1886 in the North, soliciting funds
to complete the payment of his church property. His church had by
their own efforts paid $10,000 of the $12,000, which the lot and edifice
cost. He carried many letters of recommendation from leading men
of the South.</p>

<p>Dr. Love, of Savannah, pastor of the largest Baptist church in the
world, wrote: “Rev. Charles T. Walker is one of the leading men of
Georgia and is alright.”</p>

<p>Prof Wm. E. Holmes of the Atlanta Baptist Seminary, wrote: “I
cheerfully recommend Rev. Mr. Walker and his cause to the public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
and bespeak for him the success which he richly deserves.”</p>

<p>Hon. Patrick Walsh, editor of the Augusta Chronicle wrote: “Rev.
Walker is doing a great good among his people. His church is a great
credit and both he and his people are worthy of substantial aid.”</p>

<p>Hon. R. H. May, then Mayor of the city of Augusta, wrote: “He is
a perfect gentleman, devout christian and deserving of all confidence.”</p>

<p>The testimonials Rev. Walker carried with him on this trip
might be multiplied ad infinitum.</p>

<p>In New York Rev. Justin Dewey Fulton wrote: “My people who
heard him pronounce him a preacher of more than ordinary ability.
His voice is good, his learning modest and impressive, his language
excellent, and the aim of his preaching is to glorify Christ.”</p>

<p>In Boston, Rev. J. Horatio Carter, D. D., wrote:</p>

<p>“Brother Walker is an able, earnest, logical and eloquent preacher,
and worthy of support.”</p>

<p>Rev. Walker was present at the organization of the American
National Baptist Convention in 1886 at St. Louis, Mo., and served on
the committee of constitution, and otherwise played a most prominent
part in its organization. He has attended every session every year
since, and is one of the most prominent members at its annual sessions.</p>

<p>In 1889, at Indianapolis, Ind., before this body, the Rev. Mr. Walker
preached the National sermon and that with telling effect.
At its conclusion, the Rev. William J. Simmons, D. D., L. L. D., Pres.
of the State University of Ky., walked up to the minister, shook his
hand and said, “You have won your D. D., and I’ll see that you get
it.” The following summer, at the close of the school year 89-90, Dr.
Simmons, true to his words had the trustees of the State University of
Kentucky to confer upon Rev. C. T. Walker, the honorary degree of
Doctor of Divinity which he has worthily borne ever since.</p>

<p>Writing up this session of National Baptists the Rev. Dr. Daniel
A. Gaddie, took occasion to say the Rev. Mr. Walker was “a young
man full of life and piety, beautiful and attractive in delivery. He is
an electrifying orator and waxes warm in the end. He is a great revivalist,
a finished and pointed workman.”</p>

<p>In this same convention Rev. Walker won for himself a national
reputation for his wise and conservative stand when the body had under
consideration the outlawry, lynch law and other outrages of the
South. He was referred to, by the leading newspapers of the country,
as a strong man in a crisis. The other members of the body, almost to
a man, indulged in wholesale abuse of the South; maligned its name,
hit the white people of the South some death dealing blows; excitement
ran high, Rev. Walker gained the floor and made an able speech
counseling wisdom and moderation and stating that he believed that
the best element of the white people in the North were trying, to create
a public sentiment so powerful against these outrages that they
will become impossible.</p>

</div>

<p>On 21st, of May, 1882, Rev. Walker delivered the annual
address before the Atlanta Baptist and Spelman Seminary
on the Needs and Responsibilities of the Colored
Race. It was a masterly effort. In opening the speaker
said:</p>

<p>“When our mind like the swiftly passing scene of a
panorama take a retrospective view of the past history of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
our race, and when we remember that for over two centuries,
ignorance, the mother of bigotry and superstition,
the bane of society, the prolific mother of weakness, held
our people with its slavish chains, we must admit that
many of our people have made commendable progress, and
that the influence of religion, morality and intelligence is
increasingly felt.”</p>

<p>The speaker dwelt at length upon the Needs, and then
took up the Responsibilities. Said he:</p>

<p>“We are responsible for our souls. The soul is immortal,
and cannot like the body, undergo decomposition. It
will live forever. When the mountains are melted in the
general conflagration, when the pyramids of Egypt are
levelled to the ground, when the refulgent stars, the silent
messengers, shall cease to dance in their golden sockets;
when the moon, the queen of night, refuses to give her
silvery brightness; when the sun, the king of day, the centre
of the solar system, shall be blown out; when earth is
shrouded in her regalia of mourning, and when ocean shall
gather all her waters together to chant her funeral songs,
the soul will be living somewhere in God’s distant universe.”</p>

<p>In 1884, Rev. Walker delivered the annual address on
the first day of January in Augusta. His subject was “<span class="smcap">A
Review of the Past</span>”. It was a wonderful exposition of
the progress of the Negro in America. In the course of
his remarks, he paid the following tribute to Abraham
Lincoln;</p>

<p>“Probably no man since the days of Washington was
ever so deeply and firmly imbedded and enshrined in the
hearts of the people as Abraham Lincoln. He won for himself
a place in the hearts of our people that time can never
efface. By his noble deeds, emanated from his kind
heart, he wrote his name on the pages of future time as legible
as the stars on the brow of evening.”</p>

<p>In his address at the laying of the corner stone of the
new building of the Atlanta Baptist Seminary, in 1889,
Rev. Walker said among other things:</p>

<p>“If all men would recognize the fatherhood of God, the
brotherhood of man, pledge implicit obedience to the divine
law and practice the scriptural code of ethics, there
would be no race problem. The race problem is born of
wickedness, inflamed by modern fanatics, stimulated and
encouraged by speculative, unworthy politicians. The Negro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
is a loyal, peaceable, law-abiding citizen; among them
you will find no anarchist, nihilist, liberalist, communionist
or strikers; the Negro has always been found on the
side of the constitution of his State and the Union; he isn’t
asking for supremacy or social equality; he only desires
an equal advantage in the race of life; he asks that you do
not throw impediments in his way; don’t close the gates of
prosperity against him because of his color; don’t hate him
because he was a slave, he was not so by choice; don’t despise
him because of his ignorance, it is not his fault; don’t
ignore him on account of his poverty, he has had no rich
ancestors to bequeath him landed estates. He is unfortunate,
pity him; he is struggling, help him. A bright day is
dawning. Citizens of every rank and section of this country
are uniting hand in hand to advocate such legislation as
will remove illiteracy. The last legislature of Georgia deserve
honorable mention for making appropriation for
public education. Our distinguished State School Commissioner,
Judge James S. Hook, is trying to put Georgia in
line with other states intellectually and he is succeeding admirably.
Since God has raised up so many friends for us,
both at home and abroad, let us cultivate a friendly relation
with those among whom we live. Let us have a hand
in solving our problem, shaping our destiny and making
for ourselves a creditable history.”</p>

<p>In the foregoing, we have attempted to give a short
sketch of the career of Dr. Walker, together with a few
testimonials from his friends and some extracts from his
addresses. The half has not been told. The full history
of his life would make a large volume. It ought to be
written, and will be some time. Suffice it to say that,
as a man, Dr. Walker is modest to a fault, generous in the
extreme, patient, forbearing and unselfish; as a minister,
he possesses great fervor and eloquence, and as a pulpit
orator probably he is excelled by no man in this country.
The common people hear him gladly. His highest aim is
to be an humble servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
